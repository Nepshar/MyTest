	<p>NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate conducts aeronautics research.

	NASA has made use of technologies such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which is a type of Radioisotope thermoelectric generator used on space missions.
	Shortages of this material have curtailed deep space missions since the turn of the millennia. An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was New Horizons 2.

	The earth science research program was created and first funded in the 1980s under the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.</p>

	<p>NASA started an annual competition in 2014 named Cubes in Space. It is jointly organized by NASA and the global education company I Doodle Learning, with the objective of teaching school 
	students aged 11â€“18 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a NASA rocket or balloon. On June 21, 2017 the world's smallest satellite, Kalam SAT, built by an 
	Indian team, was launched.</p>

	<p>NASA also researches and publishes on climate issues. Its statements concur with the interpretation that the global climate is heating. Bob Walker, who has advised the 45th President 
	of the United States Donald Trump on space issues, has advocated that NASA should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as NOAA.
