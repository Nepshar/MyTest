	<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets. 
	Our home planet is the only planet in our solar system known to harbour living things.<br/>
	
	The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.
However, the name Earth is an English/German word, which simply means the ground.

	<p>Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. 
	Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. 
	Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of the Earth, biodiversity has gone through long 
	periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. <br/>
	Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; 
	most species have not been described.[38] Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, 
	the world has about 200 sovereign states.
