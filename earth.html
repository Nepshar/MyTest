	<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets. 
	Our home planet is the only planet in our solar system known to harbour living things.
	
	The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.
However, the name Earth is an English/German word, which simply means the ground.

	<p>Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. 
	Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. 
	Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of the Earth, biodiversity has gone through long 
	periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. 
	Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; 
	most species have not been described. Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, 
	the world has about 200 sovereign states.
	</p>
	
	<p>Earth's water came from different places. Condensing water vapour, and comets and asteroids hitting Earth, made the oceans. 
	Within a billion years (that is at about 3.6 billion years ago) the first life evolved, in the Archaean era. Some bacteria developed photosynthesis, which lets plants make food from the 
	Sun's light and water. This released a lot of oxygen, which was first taken up by iron in solution. Eventually, free oxygen got into the atmosphere or air, making Earth's surface suitable for aerobic life (
	see Great Oxygenation Event). This oxygen also formed the ozone layer which protects Earth's surface from bad ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Complex life on the surface of the land did not exist 
	before the ozone layer.
	Earth was very different in the distant past. Long ago, almost all land was in one place. This is called a supercontinent. 
	The earliest known supercontinent was called Vaalbara. Much later, there was a time (the Cryogenian) when Earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets (glaciers).
	 This is called the Snowball Earth theory.
