	<p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is the fifth planet from the Sun.[12] Jupiter is a gas giant, both because it is so large and made up of gas. The other gas giants are
	Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

	Jupiter has a mass of 1.8986Ã—1027 kg, or about 318 Earths. This is twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System put together.<br/>

	Jupiter can be seen with the naked eye. It was known to the ancient Romans, who named it after their god Jupiter (Latin: Iuppiter). Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky. Only 
	the Earth's moon and Venus are brighter.

	Jupiter has at least 69 moons. Of these, around 50 are very small and less than five kilometres wide. The four largest moons of Jupiter are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They are called the Galilean
	 moons, because Galileo Galilei discovered them. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System. It is larger in diameter than even Mercury.

	<p>Jupiter also has a thin planetary ring system. These rings are difficult to see and were not discovered until 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 probe. There are four parts to Jupiter's rings. The 
	closest ring to Jupiter is called the Halo Ring. The next ring is called the Main Ring. It is about 6,440 km (4,002 mi) wide and only 30 km (19 mi) thick. The Main and Halo rings of Jupiter
	are made of small, dark particles. The third and fourth rings, called the Gossamer Rings, are transparent (see through) and are made from microscopic debris and dust. <br/>
	This dust probably comes from small meteors striking the surface of Jupiter's moons. The third ring is called the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, named after moon Amalthea. The outer ring, the
	Thebe Gossamer Ring, is named after the moon Thebe. The outer edge of this ring is about 220,000 km (136,702 mi) from Jupiter.

	<p>The orbit of a planet is the time and path it takes to go around the Sun. In the amount of time it takes for Jupiter to orbit the Sun one time, the Earth orbits the Sun 11.86 times. 
	One year on Jupiter is equal to 11.86 years on Earth. The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million kilometres. This is five times the distance between Earth and the Sun.
	Jupiter is not tilted on its axis as much as the Earth or Mars. This causes it to have no seasons, for example Summer or Winter. Jupiter rotates, or spins around very quickly. This causes 
	the planet to bulge in the middle. Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the Solar System. It completes one rotation or spin in 10 hours. Because of the bulge, the length of 
	the equator of Jupiter is much longer than the length from pole to pole.
